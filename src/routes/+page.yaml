  content-before: Think back to your last move. It probably evokes memories of anxiety, dread, and sweat. Summer is the season most of America’s 44.5 million renter households move. Last year roughly 17 percent of renters changed addresses. While finding new housing is stressful for all renters, housing searches can be particularly grueling for low-income families.

    The post-pandemic rise and fall in inflation has brought sharper attention to prices in a variety of economic sectors—including grocery, transportation, and child care—and apartment rents are no exception.


    Despite making up a significant portion of Americans' expenses, comprehensive and accurate data on rent prices is surprisingly scarce. In the U.S., rental data is calculated in a complicated and disjointed manner. There are multiple governmental and private-sector rental datasets that substantially diverge, often with differing methodologies.  


    Messy rental data has a real impact on addressing the affordable housing crisis in U.S. cities. Government officials not only use these data to develop rent standards for housing assistance programs—but also to geographically target affordable housing programs or decide whether to pursue regulations to address the displacement of low-income residents. To adequately address the housing crisis, accurate data is essential.  

chapter-1:
  hed: The Real Stakes of Bad Rental Data
  dek: One vivid example of these dynamics is the story of JoAnn Ellis, a soon-to-be grandmother living in the booming Phoenix metro area in 2021. 
  content: >
    As reported by the Arizona Republic, JoAnn struggled throughout her life with housing insecurity, but that year she finally got off a lengthy waitlist and received some  government help.


    Relief came in the form of the federal Housing Choice Voucher program, which assists low-income renters in finding housing on the private rental market. It pays the difference between what they can afford (set at 30 percent of their income) and the full rent of a moderately priced rental unit. However, relief soon turned into despair. JoAnn spent five months searching for an apartment, but she could not find a unit in her budget and with a landlord accepting vouchers. Housing vouchers operate under a use-it-or-lose principle and voucher holders are given a limited time for their searches. After JoAnn’s voucher expired, she was forced to move into a crowded rental with her pregnant daughter’s family.  


    Crucial context for JoAnn’s story is the rapid rent increases in Phoenix over the past few years. Market rents in the Phoenix area are reported to have risen nearly 30 percent between 2021 and 2022, faster than the rental payment standards of the federal government. Rental statistics are not just background details. How rental data are measured, aggregated, and reported directly influence the housing outcomes of renters like JoAnn. If the statistics data the government uses to set rental assistance amounts do not match the reality on the ground, people can go unhoused. It might appear as if we have a clear grasp of rental housing costs given the frequency with which these statistics are cited in housing conversations, but looking under the hood of rental statistics, one can see a much fuzzier picture.

Looking to the southwest, the Bayview neighborhood has the largest rent discrepancy in the city and is also one of the most disadvantaged. Sometimes referred to as the “Last Black neighborhood of San Francisco,” it’s an ongoing site of struggles over gentrification and displacement.

chapter-3:
  hed: 'Bad Rental Data has Policy Implications: Fair Market Rent'
  dek: To better understand what happened to JoAnn and the real-world impacts of inaccurate rental data, it’s worth diving deeper into how rental data is used to set voucher levels.  
  content-before: >
    HUD’s Fair Market Rent (FMR) standards determine voucher amounts in different metro areas. They rely on Census ACS rent estimates, local CPI measures, and other adjustment factors to determine the maximum allowed rent levels. HUD calculates the Fair Market Rent based on the 40th percentile of the gross rents paid by recent movers for non-luxury units meeting certain quality standards. If set too low, inaccurate FMRs can significantly harm renters by making housing harder to find. 


    If set too high, they can waste valuable government resources. Analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has suggested that HUD FMRs historically were set too low. To mitigate this problem, which was compounded by poor availability of ACS data due to COVID in 2021, HUD has begun supplementing public rental data sources with private rental data sources (Zillow, RealPage, Moody’s, CoStar, CoreLogic, Apartment List).

    Rental data accuracy does not only concern policymakers. Researchers use rental data to study empirical questions on neighborhood change, such as if new construction of market-rate apartments causes rents in the surrounding area to increase or decrease. Rental data is also used by residents and neighborhood activists as they engage in politics, whether it be campaigns for tenant protections or debates over proposed zoning changes.


    The low quality of rental data is even more striking when compared to the high-quality, granular records on home sale transactions. In many communities, one can find the sales price of a home because property transactions must be recorded in public registries.

chapter-4:
  hed: Types of rental data sources 
  content: 'There are three primary types of rental data: Public data, apartment listing websites, and commercial proprietary data brokers. Each data source has different strengths and limitations. Depending on the analytical question at hand, different rental data sources are better-suited than others.'

chapter-5:
  hed: How Do Rental Data Sources Diverge And Why? 
  content-before: The degree of disparities between rental data sources can be seen when comparing rent estimates from the Census ACS and Zillow. For example, compare the zip code level median gross rent estimates from the ACS and the zip code level rent from Zillow as shown in our map. Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) tracks changes in asking rents over time, with adjustments aiming to control for changes in the quality of the available rental stock. Looking nationally among zip codes with both ACS and ZORI rent estimates, the ZORI index is usually significantly larger, with the median gap of 23.6 percent.
  content-after: >
    A major source of difference between these two rental data sources is the composition of the sample. Specifically, whether the universe is only new rental contracts or all existing rental contracts (both new and old). This is an important distinction between public and private data sources. Given that rent prices have generally increased, rental data sources with only new contracts systemically report higher median rents than those with all existing rental contracts.


    Moreover, these gaps in rental data seem to have at least some structural components. While beyond the scope of this analysis, it would be informative to assess the degree that socio-economic or demographic factors at the zip code level (lower median incomes, older housing stock, and higher proportion of renters) are correlated while controlling for other confounding variables.

chapter-6:
  hed: How can rental data be improved going forward?
  content: We need to increase the awareness of the limitations in the existing rental data landscape. But knowledge alone is not sufficient. Given the importance of these data, more should be done to ensure their accuracy and timeliness. The following are four possible solutions to remedy the rental data challenge.
  solutions:
    - summary: Improve public rental data collection 
      detail: >
        Another intervention to improve rental data is the creation of local rental registries. Some municipalities, including Seattle and Los Angeles, require landlords in their jurisdictions to submit information on new rental leases for regulatory purposes. Cities such as Concord, California, require the submission of rent levels and publish this information annually as part of broader tenant protection programs. This policy could be expanded further in additional communities or more systematically applied at the state level for larger landlords.


        Standing up a rental registry requires a commitment from local governments to secure funding to adequately staff and invest in the infrastructure needed to gather this data and enforce compliance. However, past experiences have shown landlords and property owners often resist the creation of new rental registries. For success, consistent political commitment and a broad coalition of support are equally important. Given rental registries are adopted community by community, this approach alone will not comprehensively address national rental data gaps—but registries are concrete actions cities can take to tackle local data needs.

chapter-7:
  hed: Conclusion
  content: In summary, the data sources we use help us understand and interpret the world around us. For most people, housing is their largest budget item. Their rent is a number ingrained in their psyche. Yet at a system level, tracking rent is more complicated than one might expect.  A better understanding of how rental data is measured—and the limitations of this data—allows one to be more thoughtful in approaching the housing challenges faced across the country. But this is not only an academic question. Rental data has a direct link to key elements of our social safety net and needs to be taken seriously and measured accurately.
